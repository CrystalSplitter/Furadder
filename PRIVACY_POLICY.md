# PRIVACY POLICY

## Overview

FurAdder is an image scraping and uploading tool for furbooru.org,
a third party website. FurAdder is not owned by or officially related to
furbooru.org.

FurAdder is developed by individuals and hobbyists. Contact the developers of
FurAdder at https://github.com/CrystalSplitter/Furadder.

## Scraping of Data

To scrape data, FurAdder must have access to the content visible on websites
you visit. This data is ONLY collected by FurAdder upon opening the FurAdder
extension. Data is NEVER passively scraped.

Scraped data is never "at rest", and is NEVER stored in browser storage or
third party storage. It is copied to the furbooru.org upload form through
the Pop Up, and then immediately discarded. The scraped data is not submitted
or uploaded to furbooru.org.

Scraped data may include:

* Website URLs
* Images and visual media
* Dates
* Usernames
* Image Descriptions and alt text

None of these are retained by FurAdder.

## Transmission of Data

FurAdder makes HTTPS web requests to furbooru.org, which may include your IP
address.

All website content resides within your browser within content scripts.
This data is not transmitted by FurAdder. FurAdder itself does not
transmit collected data to furbooru.org, or any other third party service.

## Configuration and Tag Presets

Configuration and tag preset information is collected and stored
within browser storage. FurAdder itself does not populate browser storage with
tag presets, and tag presets should NEVER contain any personal or confidential
information. Tag preset information is NOT transmitted to a third party
service.

Tag preset information is retained until removed by the user, the extension
is updated or uninstalled, or browser extension storage is cleared.

## User Rights

Users have the right to delete all retained data, and may do so by
uninstalling the extension.

Users have a right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority regarding
FurAdder or the developers of FurAdder.
