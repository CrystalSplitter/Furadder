# Contributing

This repository will accept PRs given that they are written in a similar
style to the existing code, don't hinder the accessibility of the extension
and are done in "good faith" (see Code of Conduct) to the betterment of FurAdder and the art
community.

## Code of Conduct

> _This is a slightly simplified version of the Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct (see Attribution)_

We as contributors promise to make this repository a
welcoming and inclusive space for everyone, regardless of age, body, visible
or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex or sex characteristics, gender
identity, gender expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic
status, nationality, race, caste, colour, religion, sexual identity, and sexual
orientation.

We as a contributor are expected to:

- Show empathy and kindness to others
- Be respectful of differing opinions and experiences,
- Give and gracefully accep feedback
- Respect artist wishes at all times (particularly in regards to distribution terms and conditions)
- Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the overall community

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

- The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or advances of any kind (outside of direct usage of this project, as sexual content is inherent in the art world)
- Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing othersâ€™ private information, such as a physical address or email address, without their explicit permission
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Enforcement

If it's determined by the FurAdder leaders that a member of the community has violated the
above expectations for a contributor, then these leaders may impose an indefinite ban on that
member of the community.

FurAdder leaders have the right and responsibility to review, edit, or deny any contributions which
violate or are not aligned with this Code of Conduct.

## Scope

This code of conduct applies to all contributors and potential contributors to
FurAdder, as well as individuals acting as
representatives of FurAdder or the FurAdder
community.

## Attribution

This code of conduct was partially adapted from the [Contributor Covenant version 2.1](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/2/1/code_of_conduct.html).
